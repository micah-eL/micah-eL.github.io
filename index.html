                            The Spring 2022 semester marked the start of my fourth year at Simon Fraser University majoring in Computer Science.
                            It also marked my first semester at SFU since retiring from the <a href="https://athletics.sfu.ca/sports/mens-swimming-and-diving/roster/micah-lau/4908">SFU Men's Varsity Swim team</a>.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Through the first two years of my undergraduate degree, I spent a great deal of energy trying to balance varsity athletics with a full CS course load. 
                            Although some may argue, I believe this balancing act is often a zero-sum game. 
                            As such, I wasn’t able to perform at my full potential in both my athletic and academic pursuits.  
                            <br>
                            However, going into my third year, I stopped training as heavily - in large part because of an issue between <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/sfu-swimming-coach-1.5456778">administration and the coaching staff</a>, but also because I found that I had become much more excited and driven by opportunities presenting themselves outside the pool. 
                            As that 2020/21 school year progressed, I found myself spending less and less time in the pool, which gave me more time than ever to invest in my academics.
                            This began to show in my grades and in the confidence in my academic abilities.
                            This all culminated in landing an SDE internship with <a href="https://www.formswim.com/">FORM</a> and finally making the decision to retire from swimming.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            May 2021, I started my internship at FORM and my life without swimming. 
                            Of course, without the countless hours spent in the pool or weight room, I found that I had so much more time and energy.
                            No more living at the pool. 
                            No more struggling to find time to finish schoolwork. 
                            And my favorite - no more getting up at 5:00am to jump into cold pools.
                            As such, I started filling every free hour of my day up learning new things and just exploring my other interests further, which included making this website! 
                            <br>
                            And now I am in the midst of my 4th year of classes; my remaining upper division courses will reflect my Computer Systems and Information Systems concentrations. 
                            Outside of classes, I coach with Hyack Swim Club and I'm continuously looking to learn new things, whether that be by working on side projects or reading through papers.
                            I'm also currently looking for a Fall 2022 internship, so I'd love to hear about any opportunities!
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I hope you enjoy looking through my website and the projects I’ve worked on.
                            Of course, now that I have more time and energy than I know what to do with, I’ll be continuously adding new projects I work on, so I hope you come back to check those out as well.

                                        And as corny as it sounds, when I came in for my first varsity swim team practice, I finally understood what everyone meant.
                                        I really don't think I'll ever forget that feeling of excitement during those first few practices.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        On the academic side of things, I also experienced something pretty incredible for the first time ever - programming!
                                        CMPT 120 at SFU was the first time I had ever programmed and what an experience that was.
                                        As frustrating as it was to grasp some concepts, I immediately took a liking to programming. 
                                        I really enjoyed how the work you put in is shown with a tangible end result, just like with swimming.
                                        If you put in the work during practice, you're rewarded with best times at competitions.
                                        Likewise, if you take the time to understand fundamental concepts and really put the work in, you're rewarded with a (mostly) bug-free program!

                                        Because I was only doing 2 classes for the summer semester (the full course load mandated by the NCAA is only in effect during the fall and spring semesters), along with a few friends, I decided to give coaching a try at a local swim club.
                                        All 4 months were a blast and just being able to teach kids about a sport that has given me so much is such an incredibly rewarding experience.

                                        At this point, all of my assignments in my CS classes were essentially just terminal based programs that implemented some algorithm or data structure. 
                                        As such, I wanted to make something more tangible.
                                        It was around this time that I first started using Chrome extensions and one of the first ones I was introduced to was uBlock Origin.
                                        Feeling inspired, I set out to make the next uBlock Origin but unfortunately, that goal was a little ambitious considering I had never used HTML/CSS/JS prior to this.
                                        <br>
                                        I started with a simple one - a webpage background color modifier, before moving onto one that was a little more complex. 
                                        The Censor Chrome extension allows you to replace words on website with "CENSORED" and it was inspired by a similar terminal-based C program I did in one of my spring semester classes.

                                        My second year of university was fairly uneventful, apart from COVID-19 coming in during that back end of the spring 2020 semester.
                                        It was actually during that spring semester that I took one of the most informative classes so far - Discrete Math 2.
                                        With how difficult it was, I definitely did not enjoy it at the time, but looking back at it now, that class taught me so much, with a large portion of the curriculum focused on graph theory.
                                        Of course, it helped that the legend Dr. Jamie Mulholland was teaching it.

                                        Unfortunately, on the swimming side of things, the course load of the Computer Science program was starting to take its toll and I ended up swimming pretty poorly throughout the season.

                                        2-player version of the classic Hangman game for iOS.
                                        This 2-player version allows player 1 to input a word, then pass the phone to player 2 who must guess the word.

                                        This game was developed while self-learning Swift just as a way to get familiar with the syntax so it is a pretty 'hacky' app without any real app architecture and just using @State variables.

                                        Because I was only doing 2 classes during the summer semester, I returned for a second summer coaching at a local swim club. 
                                        Although COVID-19 reduced the season down to two short months and removed the possibility of official competitions, I still had a blast coaching once again!
                                        This summer, I was given the role of co-head coach and Senior group lead coach.
                                        I was also in charge of all 3 competitive groups.
                                        This entailed managing 2 other coaches and  around 50 swimmers. 
                                        One of the big things I’m really proud of having accomplished during the season was organizing 2 of the first swimming competitions held amidst BC's provincial health guidelines. 
                                        Originally we weren’t going to have any competitions because of COVID, but with lots of careful planning and communication with the City of Burnaby, I was able to succusfully run 2 inter-club competitions.

                                        This was definitely the most eventful year for me, from online classes, to making the decision to retire from swimming.
                                        I'd say the hardest part of this year was the fact that classes were online. 
                                        I love being able to work with people face-to-face so the online format really ruined my productivity.
                                        And of course, Zoom lectures just put me to sleep.
                                        But even with the online format, I took what became my favorite class so far: Intro to Software Engineering.
                                        In this class, I did my first big group project and got to experience a complete software development life cycle. 
                                        A big part of my enjoyment of this class can definitely be attributed to having a great prof - I’d highly recommend taking a class with Dr. Brian Fraser if you ever get the chance! 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Now if you've read my About Me section, you'll know that this was the year I decided to retire from swimming.
                                        This was mostly attributed to no longer being able to balance my academic and athletic endeavours. 
                                        I’d get up at 4:30am to do a practice, go to lectures barely awake, then get back in the pool for a second practice. 
                                        And of course, once I finally got home, I had to force myself to stay awake to study mentally challenging concepts late into the night. 
                                        Then I’d fall asleep for a few hours of sleep before repeating it all over.
                                        It was just a really draining routine that prevented me from reaching my full potential in both my athletics and academics.

                                        This was the first class project I had done that was a real tangible 'product' as opposed to implementing some algorithm or simple command line program. 
                                        The game was implemented with Java and Android Studio, and GitLab was used as a version control system.
                                        JUnit5 was also used to create unit tests.
                                        The game is played the same way as the classic Minesweeper game with remaining mine (zombie) counts updating on every button click.
                                        The game also includes the ability to change the grid size as well as the number of zombies to find. 
                                        Unfortunately the code for this project cannot be shared publicly due to university and class policies.

                                        The Practical Parent app is an Android app designed to help parents with the difficult task of raising children.
                                        This was the first time I had done a project in a group this big and what made it even harder was the fact that all communication was remote. 
                                        A big part of this project was using a Scrum development process, so we all got to take turns playing different roles like Scrum master or product owner each sprint. 
                                        We used GitLab as a VCS and had code review meetings and calls to review merge requests. 
                                        The app includes guided (visual and audio) meditation, a chore/task tracking system, a timer for timeouts (with a sneaky ability to slow down or speed up time), as well as a visually appealing coin flip for settling those pesky arguements.

                                        The best part of this project was that I got to experience both front end and back end work which allowed me to get a feel for what I do and don't enjoy with regards to web development.
                                        The front end was pure HTML/CSS/JS and we used Flask to connect to our MySQL database.

                                        I was fortunate enough to land an 8-month SDE internship with FORM.
                                        The bulk of my work is comprised of developing internal tools using Python, Bash, and Javascript, specifically for the goggle firmware, by leveraging tools such as a ST-Link, OpenOCD, and CoolTerm.
                                        I've also developed a bunch of automation scripts using Newman/Postman in conjunction with various web API endpoints, as well as Appium.
                                        The code I write specifically for the goggle firmware must all take the limited memory on the embedded system into consideration. 
                                        I also take advantage of multi-threading to execute time-sensitive commands. 
                                        On top of this, I also spent some time working with the embedded team to debug firmware issues.

                                        Other than the fact that I get to combine my passion for swimming and technology, the best part about working at FORM really has been the workplace culture.
                                        Everyone has been super friendly and I've gotten the chance to talk to many people working in different teams, from Machine Learning to Hardware.

                                        Most of this website was made with HTML/CSS/JS. 
                                        I originally had some basic Flask included because I intend on expanding this website to include separate pages and a more sophisticated backend, and I was going to use Flask to handle the routing.
                                        However, to use GitHub Pages as my temporary web host, I had to remove Flask from this iteration of my personal website.  
                                        I also used some Bootstrap components such as their responsive navbar to improve the mobile experience.

                                        As a big fan of the UFC, I wanted a quick way to check changes in each division's rankings.
                                        The functionality of this Python script is fairly simple at the moment as this was my first foray into web scraping, but I intend on adding more features as well as a user interface sometime in the near future. 
                                        I will most likely start by adding the ability to pull fight details for upcoming events, but if you are a MMA fan and have any recommendations/requests, feel free to reach out!

                                        As the next Jordan Belfort, I wanted a quick way to check the current value of my investments without having to log into various banking accounts.
                                        As such, I created this simple website + database setup that allows you to do just that! 
                                        The functionality of this website it pretty simple - it allows you to search stocks and ETFs, and also save a 'Portfolio' with various stocks and ETFs, along with the purchase price and quantity. 
                                        Of course, you can also add and remove stocks from your Portfolio.

                                        Last fall, during CMPT 276 (one of my favorite classes), I learned about MVC for Android app development and so I wanted to learn the MVVM design pattern for iOS apps. 
                                        This game was developed as a way to help me grasp this concept of MVVM in iOS apps.
                                        I watched a few lectures from Stanford's CS193p to help understand the fundamentals and this app is based off of the first few homework assignemts from that class.

                                        This project was a fun little supplement to some reading I've been doing into networking related things.
                                        It consists of a very bare-bones API which acts as the middle man between my iOS app and a MySQL database.
                                        The idea for a swim team themed app came from some friends on the SFU swim team who are currently using an Excel "database" to keep track of various things. 
                                        <br>
                                        As you can see the API is pretty minimal and doesn't have a front end although I am thinking about trying out Swagger.
                                        <br>
                                        The app is also pretty minimal and doesn't follow any sort of design pattern.

                                        My recent interest in the lower level aspects of computer science stems from my interest in learning how things work.
                                        But not just a superficial understanding, but a deep - usually all the way down to hardware - understanding of what exactly is going on.
                                        Often times this can be to my detriment because sometimes that formula they give you in your Numerical Analysis or Linear Algebra class is meant to be memorized and used, not studied for hours on end!
                                        But regardless, this project was another case of me going down the rabbit hole, this time with computer networking.
                                        I ended up picking up Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 6th edition, and after having read a few chapters, I'd highly recommend reading through at least the first chapter.
                                        Some of the information presented really made me re-evaluate how much I thought I knew about things like the Internet and the World Wide Web. 
                                        This application was actually inpsired by the example Python application in chapter 2.7.2 of this textbook. 
                                        <br><br>
                                        These two C programs make use of Unix‘s networking API and they just follow a basic TCP connection flow.
                                        Server-side:
                                        <br><br>
                                        getaddrinfo() -> socket() -> bind() -> listen() and accept() -> fork() -> recv() and send() -> close() child process -> repeat from listen() and accept()
                                        <br><br>
                                        Client-side:
                                        <br><br>
                                        getaddrinfo() -> socket() -> connect() -> send() and recv() ->  close() and shutdown()
                                        <br><br>
                                        One thing that tripped me up at first was getaddrinfo() returning a linked list.
                                        It does this because a host could have multiple ways to contact to it, for example, the network host could be accessible over both a TCP and UDP connection.
                                        <br>
                                        And no, 192.168.0.5 isn't really my IP address, I hope you knew that without having to read a computer networking textbook.

                                        This project extends on my xSwimTeam project - this REST API will eventually replace that Python API I'm currently using in my iOS app.
                                        I used the MERN stack for this (although there is currently no React) mainly because I have never used Node, Express, or MongoDB, and I wanted to try them out.
                                        <br>
                                        I'll definitely come back to this because I want to try adding OAuth.
                                        I also obviously need to finish up the remaining endpoints.
                                        I've found that I get bored very quickly once the work starts getting repetitive.
                                        Like the thought of just copying and pasting the existing endpoints to create more endpoints is why I want to take a break from this.
                                        However, it does seem like I am not alone in this habit of leaving side projects half finished so I've found some solace in that.

                                        I recently completed my (first) internship at FORM and I still can’t believe how fast these past 8 months flew by. 
                                        Not only did I learn a ton, but I also had fun the whole time!
                                        I understand what people mean by WLB and team culture at work a lot better now, and I’m glad I know what to seek out in future internships and full-time positions once I graduate. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        But really, this whole year just flew by and what a year it was. 
                                        I finished my third year of university, retired from swimming, completed my first internship, got back into coaching, worked on some cool side projects (I can’t believe I’ve only had this website up for a few months), and sort of (?) figured out how to workout on my own. 
                                        Oh and I also feel like I’ve recovered some of the sleep debt I’ve accumulated from those late night study sessions and 5:00am practices, but I’ll continue to chip away at that in the years to come. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        These past few weeks, I’ve been doing a lot of coaching and also working on a few things oustside of work, but I've also taken some time to relax.
                                        <br>
                                        For side projects, I've started working on, and currently have a semi-working HTTP server that you can take a look at on my <a id="modalLink" href="https://github.com/micah-eL/http_server">GitHub</a>.
                                        Right now it’s just hard coded to return a few very basic HTML documents because I’m still working on that load_file() helper method.
                                        <br>
                                        I also spent a bit more time on my xSwimTeam REST API and I ended up implementing some basic authorization using JSON web tokens. 
                                        <br>
                                        Aside from those side projects, I've also spent some more time just reading about system design patterns because I’ve found it really cool to see how some of the concepts that are being taught in our CS classes are being used to solve real world problems. 
                                        One article that I really enjoyed reading was this <a id="modalLink" href="https://nickcraver.com/blog/2016/02/17/stack-overflow-the-architecture-2016-edition/">Stack Overflow article</a>.
                                        I was originally intrigued by this stuff after spending some time talking with some of the senior engineers at FORM about the back end infrastructure they had set up when the company was just getting started, and how it has evolved into what it is today. 
                                        In fact, this was one of my main motivations for my xSwimTeam iOS app + REST API project. 
                                        Seeing how everything is connected in the big picture is just so incredibly satisfying, but it also serves as a reminder that these services that seem simple at first actually have a complex but efficient design. 
                                        For example, caching seems simple in theory, but there are a few things you might not think about if you've never actually implemented it. 
                                        In a mobile app we can cache network responses using key-value storage, where keys are the URLs, and the values are the JSON responses. 
                                        This seems pretty straightforward, but now remember that some network requests, like network requests that are paginated, won’t have unique URLs (the "nextCursor" string used to represent the current page is usually sent in the request body), meaning you can’t just use the URL as the cache key.
                                        This means that basically any URL that specifies uniqueness to the API in their request body needs to specify a unique cache key, usually by extracting the appropriate parameter (ex. nextCursor) from the request body and into the URL.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Anyways, tomorrow, 2022 starts and I’ll be turning my attention to my classes for this upcoming Spring semester, and of course with my internship having come to an end, I’m looking ahead for future internship opportunities (particularly Fall 2022 internships). 
                                        I can’t believe the last time I took classes was a year ago during Spring 2021!
                                        While I will miss all the support that comes with being a varsity athlete, I am looking forward to immersing myself fully in my academics now. 
                                        I’m especially excited to get back to in classes because they’re back in person; online classes were just not my thing.

                                        First of all - in person classes. Just so much better than online classes.
                                        I hated online classes mainly because it was literally impossible to ask questions.
                                        But on top of that, all my profs seemed to have all collectively decided to turn 3 x 50-minute lectures into  5 x 1.5-hour lectures with "additional help" in the form of more videos.
                                        In-person classes > online classes.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Also, with this being my first semester of classes since retiring from swimming, the other big thing was actually having time and energy to study properly.
                                        Now I was still working (coaching) this entire semester which involved multiple 5:00am practices per week, but there's such a huge difference between just coaching and actually swimming and pushing yourself to your limits for hours.   
                                        So, surprise surprise, with the time and energy to dedicate myself fully to my classes, I had my best academic term by a longshot. 
                                        So far I've gotten my grades back for 2 classes - an A+ in <a id="modalLink" href="http://www.sfu.ca/outlines.html?2022/spring/cmpt/300/d100">CMPT 300: Operating Systems</a>, and an A in <a id="modalLink" href="https://www.sfu.ca/outlines.html?2022/spring/cmpt/307/d100">CMPT 307: Data Structures and Algorithms</a>.
                                        My lame excuse for not getting an A+ in 307 is that I just was not ready for some of the weird questions asked on the midterms.  
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The other thing I was focusing on this semester was lots and lots of LeetCode to prep for interviews. 
                                        The Fall 2022 internship applications were far and few between throughout the semester, but over this last week of April they've all started opening up so I'm looking forward to hopefully not too many rejections.
