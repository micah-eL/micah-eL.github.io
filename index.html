                            This upcoming fall will mark the start of my fourth year at Simon Fraser University majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Business.
                            It will also mark the first year that I am no longer a part of the <a href="https://athletics.sfu.ca/sports/mens-swimming-and-diving/roster/micah-lau/4908">SFU Men's Varsity Swim team</a>.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            For the past 9 years I’ve been fortunate enough to call myself a swimmer, and what a ride it has been.
                            Now finally, this past spring semester, like many other collegiate swimmers, I finished one of the best jobs I’ll ever have: being a student-athlete at Simon Fraser University. 
                            <br>
                            Through the first two years of my undergraduate degree, I spent a great deal of energy trying to balance varsity athletics with a full CS course load. 
                            Although some may argue, I believe this balancing act is often a zero-sum situation.
                            As such, I wasn’t able to perform at my full potential in both my athletic and academic pursuits. 
                            <br>
                            However, going into my third year, I stopped training as heavily - in large part because of an issue between <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/sfu-swimming-coach-1.5456778">administration and the coaching staff</a>, but also because I found that I had become much more excited and driven by opportunities presenting themselves outside the pool. 
                            As the year progressed, I found myself spending less and less time in the pool, which gave me more time than ever to invest in my academics.
                            This began to show in my grades and in the confidence in my academic abilities.
                            This all culminated in landing an internship with <a href="https://www.formswim.com/">FORM</a> and finally making the decision to retire from swimming. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            May 2021, I started my internship at FORM and my life without swimming. 
                            Even while working a full 40-hour work week, I’ve found that I have so much more time and energy than when I was swimming and taking a full course load.
                            As such, I started filling every free hour of my day up learning new things and just exploring my other interests further, which included making this website!
                            This extra time has also given me a lot of time to self reflect as well. 
                            I remember when I first created my LinkedIn account, I always noticed how it was filled with individuals sharing their job experience and I often found myself feeling left out or underachieving. 
                            However, I've come to realize that being a student-athlete is hard and it’s something to be proud of too!
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            So, what is next for me in my transition to a retired athlete? Well, to start, I realized that I was never setting clear academic-centered goals for myself like I did constantly with swimming. 
                            As such, I started setting some career related goals for the first time ever, such as getting this website made. 
                            I’ve started planning for future internships, future classes, future projects, you name it.
                            <br>
                            But most importantly, I’ve given myself time to just enjoy life. No more living at the pool. No more struggling to find time to finish schoolwork. 
                            And my favorite - no more getting up at 5:00am to jump into cold pools.
                            <br>
                            With that being said, I hope you enjoy looking through my website as well as some of the projects I’ve worked on.
                            Of course, now that I have more time and energy than I know what to do with, I’ll be continuously adding new projects I work on, so I hope you come back to check those out as well.

                                        I was always told collegiate sports is an experience you need to be a part of to truly understand. 
                                        And as corny as it sounds, when I came in for my first varsity swim team practice, I finally understood what everyone meant.
                                        I really don't think I'll ever forget that feeling of excitement during those first few practices.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        On the academic side of things, I also experienced something pretty incredible for the first time ever - programming!
                                        CMPT 120 at SFU was the first time I had ever programmed and what an experience that was.
                                        As frustrating as it was to grasp some concepts, I immediately took a liking to programming. 
                                        I really enjoyed how the work you put in is shown with a tangible end result, just like with swimming.
                                        If you put in the work during practice, you're rewarded with best times at competitions.
                                        Likewise, if you take the time to understand fundamental concepts and really put the work in, you're rewarded with a (mostly) bug-free program!    
                                    </p>

                                        Because I was only doing 2 classes for the summer semester (the full course load mandated by the NCAA is only in effect during the fall and spring semesters), along with a few friends, I decided to give coaching a try at a local swim club.
                                        A few weeks in, I could not believe how much fun I was having.
                                        Being able to teach kids about a sport that has given me so much was such an incredibly rewarding experience.
                                        To this day, coaching is something I still do on a part-time basis, here and there, because of how much I enjoy it.

                                        At this point, all of my assignments in my CS classes were essentially just terminal based programs that implemented some algorithm or data structure. 
                                        As such, I wanted to make something more tangible.
                                        It was around this time that I first started using Chrome extensions and one of the first ones I was introduced to was uBlock Origin.
                                        Feeling inspired, I set out to make the next uBlock Origin but unfortunately, that goal was a little ambitious considering I had never used HTML/CSS/JS prior to this.
                                        <br>
                                        I started with a simple one - a webpage background color modifier, before moving onto one that was a little more complex. 
                                        The Censor Chrome extension allows you to replace words on website with "CENSORED" and it was inspired by a similar terminal-based C program I did in one of my spring semester classes.

                                        My second year of university was fairly uneventful, apart from COVID-19 coming in during that back end of the spring 2020 semester.
                                        It was actually during that spring semester that I took one of the most informative classes so far - Discrete Math 2.
                                        With how difficult it was, I definitely did not enjoy it at the time, but looking back at it now, that class taught me so much, with a large portion of the curriculum focused on graph theory.
                                        Of course, it helped that the legend Dr. Jamie Mulholland was teaching it.

                                        <br>
                                        Unfortunately, on the swimming side of things, the course load of the Computer Science program was starting to take its toll and I ended up swimming pretty poorly throughout the season.

                                        Because I was only doing 2 classes during the summer semester, I returned for a second summer coaching at a local swim club. 
                                        Although COVID-19 reduced the season down to two short months and removed the possibility of official competitions, I still had a blast coaching once again!
                                        This summer, I was given the role of co-head coach and I was also in charge of all 3 competitive groups.
                                        This entailed managing 2 other coaches and  around 50 swimmers. 
                                        One of the big things I’m really proud of having accomplished during the season was organizing 2 swimming competitions. 
                                        Originally we weren’t going to have any competitions because of COVID, but with lots of careful planning and communication with the City of Burnaby, I was able to succusfully run 2 inter-club competitions.

                                        This was definitely the most eventful year for me, from online classes, to making the decision to retire from swimming.
                                        I'd say the hardest part of this year was the fact that classes were online. 
                                        I love being able to work with people face-to-face so the online format really ruined my productivity.
                                        And of course, Zoom lectures just put me to sleep.
                                        But even with the online format, I took what became my favorite class so far: Intro to Software Engineering.
                                        In this class, I did my first big group project and got to experience a complete software development life cycle. 
                                        A big part of my enjoyment of this class can definitely be attributed to having a great prof - I’d highly recommend taking a class with Dr. Brian Fraser if you ever get the chance! 
                                        <br>

                                        Now if you've read my About Me section, you'll know that this was the year I decided to retire from swimming.
                                        This was mostly attributed to no longer being able to balance my academic and athletic endeavours. 
                                        I’d get up at 4:30am to do a practice, go to lectures barely awake, then get back in the pool for a second practice. 
                                        And of course, once I finally got home, I had to force myself to stay awake to study mentally challenging concepts late into the night. 
                                        Then I’d fall asleep for a few hours of sleep before repeating it all over.
                                        It was just a really draining routine that prevented me from reaching my full potential in both my athletics and academics.

                                        This was the first class project I had done that was a real tangible 'product' as opposed to implementing some algorithm or simple command line program. 
                                        The game was implemented with Java and Android Studio, and GitLab was used as a version control system.
                                        JUnit5 was also used to create unit tests.
                                        The game is played teh same way as the classic Minesweeper game with remaining mine (zombie) counts updating on every button click.
                                        The game also includes the ability to change the grid size as well as the number of zombies to find. 
                                        Unfortunately the code for this project cannot be shared publicly due to university and class policies.

                                        The Practical Parent app is an Android app designed to help parents with the difficult task of raising children.
                                        This was the first time I had done a project in a group this big and what made it even harder was the fact that all communication was remote. 
                                        A big part of this project was using a Scrum development process, so we all got to take turns playing different roles like Scrum master or product owner each sprint. 
                                        We used GitLab as a VCS and had code review meetings and calls to review merge requests. 
                                        The app includes guided (visual and audio) meditation, a chore/task tracking system, a timer for timeouts (with a sneaky ability to slow down or speed up time), as well as a visually appealing coin flip for settling those pesky arguements.

                                        I was fortunate enough to land an 8-month SDET internship with FORM.
                                        The bulk of my work is comprised of developing automation scripts for the goggle software, leveraging tools such as a ST-Link, OpenOCD, and CoolTerm.
                                        I write Python and Bash scripts which must take the limited memory on the embedded system into consideration. 
                                        I also take advantage of multi-threading to execute time-sensitive commands. 
                                        On top of this, I also spent some time working with the embedded team to debug firmware issues.
                                        In addition to automation scripts for the goggle software, I've worked with Newman/Postman in conjunction with various web APIs, as well as Appium.

                                        <br>
                                        Other than the fact that I get to combine my passion for swimming and technology, the best part about working at FORM really has been the workplace culture.
                                        Everyone has been super friendly and I've gotten the chance to talk to many people working in different teams, from Machine Learning to Hardware.

                                        Most of this website was made with HTML/CSS/JS. 
                                        I originally had some basic Flask included because I intend on expanding this website to include separate pages and a more sophisticated backend, so I'll be using Flask to handle the routing.
                                        However, to use GitHub Pages as my temporary web host, I had to remove Flask from this iteration of my personal website.  
                                        I also used some Bootstrap components such as their responsive navbar to improve the mobile experience.

                                        As a big fan of the UFC, I wanted a quick way to check changes in each division's rankings.
                                        The functionality of this Python script is fairly simple at the moment as this was my first foray into web scraping, but I intend on adding more features as well as a user interface sometime in the near future. 
                                        I will most likely start by adding the ability to pull fight details for upcoming events, but if you are a MMA fan and have any recommendations/requests, feel free to reach out!
